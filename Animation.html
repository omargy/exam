                <p> in Css and Javascript i started by making a github profile and then i had to take a character from the internet and make her do things and here underneath is the link where you can make the character do couple of things.

                    the character design and storytelling was cancelled if i remember right but i did some characters and a background before that and made a sprite sheet of a walking man in Illustrator but i had some problems putting the sprite sheet here so i decided not to put it in.

                    in more javascript i was supposed to choose two projects and bring them to life and i decided to choose something that could be of use in my websites so i chose to make a animated menu and i used it as my index page the first time i took the exam but decided to keep it out of the website this time, but you can see the menu here below.

                <p>
                    This group project was a huge mess since we could never decide what to do and i dont even know if the project is finished yet. we were supposed to do a interactive poster for a film of our choosing and we chose E.T, i did what i was tasked with and that was making the bikes and the police car, i also made some gifs that people didnt want to use.
