                <p>
                    A story without words was a great assignment but since i didnt have a group member it was really hard to record and i had to get a friend to act for me last minute and it was a horendous end result for me since i had alot of ideas but since i was alone i could not use those ideas and had to pull something out of my hat, but i did learn how premier pro worked so it taught me something.

                <p>
                    The bicycle guide was pretty fun to do and i was in charge of the video, sound and cutting the material since my partner lived so far away and we could barely meet up so i just recorded myself and he made the website and since its so late right now i cant get the link to the website but i will put the video here since i didnt do anything on the website.
