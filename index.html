                <p> As seem from above im from a little town in east Iceland with around thousand people and there is not much to do there and not alot of job opportunities except for working in a aluminum factory, fish or at a small shop/company so i wanted to try to move to a bigger city to get a education so i wont have to get stuck in a job like that and hopefully i can be my own boss.

                    Im a 24 year old man who's soon becoming a father and i like to play and watch football and i also have interest in fitness, i have thought long and hard what i would like to do with my life and finally i found something i can actually study since ive never been good at school. I wouldnt say im 100% sure that my study here will become my future job but im as sure as i will ever be that i found something i do have interest in.

                <p>
                    i do have alot of work experience but that experience doesnt really matter here since ive mostly worked in fish, aluminum factory and as a some sort of a vikar. But i started working when i was 14 with school and ive done it ever since, either with school or full time, but my experience isnt much in multimedia designing, i was in a photoshop class for a semester once and thats probably the only experience i had before i came to this school.
