                <p>
                    User reasearch and Design got us as a group to talk and throw in ideas and then draw ideas down and then we chose what we liked the best and then we talked to people from other groups and teachers to get a feedback and it was a pretty good exercise in communication and to take both good and bad reviews.

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    The Design sprint was pretty similar to the former sprint but the only difference here is i had a pretty small part since we were 5 or 6 in the group so i just had to find most of the text that we used and ofcourse i took part in the ideas involving the app and some of the features.
